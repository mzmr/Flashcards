This is my very first Java program. It's intended to improve learning foreign languages. I'm using it to learn English and it works perfectly for me (although it's not perfect).

Features
--------
- write in words and expressions you'd like to learn with their translations
- save your data into the CSV files - easy to read outside this application, possible to open with external productivity software
- learn new words fast and easy due to many repetitions displaying automatically on your screen in given time intervals
- export words to the PDF file prepared to print and cut to use as flashcards
- application remembers all of your settings and open the last opened words set at the start
- check your knowledge -> proceed to the test and get percentage result
